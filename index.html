        <h2>Welcome</h2>
    
        <p>Hey there, I’m Chris P. Vine, a full-stack developer in training, creator at heart, and lifelong builder. Currently, I’m diving deep into the world of web development & applications — learning how to turn ideas into interactive, meaningful digital experiences.</p>
        <p> I’m married and a proud dad of three incredible kids who keep life both busy and inspiring. When I’m not buried in code or exploring new frameworks, you’ll usually find me jamming on guitar or drums, experimenting in the kitchen, or listening to music from every corner of the world. I believe creativity crosses boundaries — whether it’s writing clean code, cooking a great meal, or crafting a rhythm that feels just right.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>My Interests & Inspirations</strong></p>
        <p>I draw a lot of creativity fueled by storytellers and visionaries — especially Taylor Sheridan, whose work on Yellowstone, 1883, and Tulsa King captures grit, purpose, and resilience — values I try to bring into everything I build.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>My Philosophy</strong></p>
        <p>Coding, for me, isn’t just about syntax or solving bugs — it’s about freedom. The freedom to create, to automate, to build tools that make life a little smoother and more connected. I see software as a modern form of craftsmanship — equal parts art and engineering — and I’m learning to master both sides.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Beyond the Screen</strong></p>
        <p>When I’m not developing or designing, I love spending time outdoors, working on projects around the house, or just soaking up a quiet evening with my family. I’m big on curiosity, simplicity, and the belief that every day is a new chance to build something better — whether it’s code, a business, or yourself.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Take a look around, check out my links, and enjoy the ride. Thanks for visiting — and welcome to the start of something great.</p>
